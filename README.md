# Analyzing Data with Power BI

The following steps must be completed to ensure the Allfiles function correctly in the VMs:

1. Download the zip for each module from this folder, and extract the files to the **D:** folder on the VM. The file structure should be:
    ```
    D:\Demofiles\Mod01\...
    D:\Demofiles\Mod02\...
    D:\Demofiles\Mod03\...
    ... etc.
    D:\Labfiles\Lab01\...
    D:\Labfiles\Lab02\...
    D:\Labfiles\Lab03\...
    ... etc.
    D:\Setupfiles\...
    ```

2. On VM, once the files are extracted, view the properties of the **D:** drive, and on the **Security** tab, grant the **Everyone** group **Full Control** access to the drive and all its subfolders.

3. In the **D:** drive, view the properties of each folder (**Demofiles**, **Labfiles**, and **Setupfiles**) in turn and clear the **Read-only** check box so that no files on the **D:** drive are set to read-only.
