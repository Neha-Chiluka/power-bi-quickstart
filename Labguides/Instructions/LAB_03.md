# Module 3: Transform Data - Power Query Editor

Transforming data is very crucial part of data analysis. It is very important to clean the data before we actually start with data modelling or data visualization.

Let us understand the functionality of Transforming data and the tools that help us with data cleaning!

In your Report View, you can find the transform data option on the toolbar.

- Click on it. 

- You will get a new window with the name "Power Query Editor".

Once inside the Power Query Editor, you will see a number of options in the Transform tab, which allow you to modify the data you are  working with.

**Column Management**
1. Remove Columns: Allows you to remove selected columns from the query.

3. Add Column: Add new columns based on transformations or formulas.

5. Rename Columns: Renames selected columns for clarity.

7. Duplicate Column: Create a copy of a selected column.

9. Merge Columns: Combine multiple columns into one.

**Data Type Transformations**
1. Data Type: Change the data type (e.g., text, number, date, etc.) of a selected column.

3. Detect Data Type: Automatically detect and set the correct data type for each column.


- Sort Ascending/Descending: Sort rows based on the selected column in ascending or descending order.

- Remove Duplicates: Remove duplicate rows based on selected columns.

- Filter: Set filters to only show rows that match specific conditions (e.g., greater than a certain value, equals a text value, etc.).
- Text Transformations

- Extract: Extract part of a text string using patterns like regex, or by delimiters.

- Format: Change text formatting, such as uppercase, lowercase, etc.

- Trim: Remove extra spaces from the beginning and end of a text string.

- Replace Values: Replace specific text or values with others in a column.

**Date and Time**
1. Date/Time Transformations: Modify dates or times, such as extracting the year, month, day, or creating new columns based on dates (e.g., weekday, quarter).

3. Add Column from Date/Time: Create new columns based on the existing date or time fields (e.g., extract a year from a DateTime column).

**Group By**
- Group data by one or more columns to perform aggregation (like sum, average, etc.) on other columns in the dataset.

**Pivot/Unpivot**
1. Pivot: Turn unique values in a column into multiple columns, often used to transform data into a more useful format.

3. Unpivot: Convert columns into rows, usually when data is in a wide format and needs to be normalized into a tall format.
