# Module 5: Publishing And Exporting Files In PowerBI

In Power BI, saving, publishing, or exporting a report involves different processes depending on your goal—whether you are saving a local copy, sharing the report with others, or exporting the data for further analysis. 

Below is an overview of these actions:

**1. Saving the Power BI File (.pbix)**
When you create a report in Power BI Desktop, you typically save your work as a .pbix file, which is the native file format for Power BI Desktop reports.

**Save a Report Locally:**

After you have created or modified your report, you can save it by going to the File menu in Power BI Desktop and selecting Save or Save As.

This saves the report locally on your computer as a .pbix file, allowing you to reopen and work on it later.

**Note:** Saving does not upload or share the report with others; it's for your own local storage.

**2. Publishing the Power BI Report**

Once you're satisfied with your report in Power BI Desktop, you can publish it to the Power BI Service (Power BI online platform) to share and collaborate with others, and also to schedule refreshes of data.

**Publish to Power BI Service:**

- From Power BI Desktop, click on the Home ribbon and then click the Publish button.

- You’ll be prompted to log in to your Power BI account (if you're not already logged in).

- After logging in, you'll select the workspace where you want to publish the report.

- Once published, the report is available in the Power BI Service under your selected workspace.

- You can then share the report with colleagues, schedule data refreshes, and manage access permissions (who can view, edit, or share the report).

**Important Considerations:**

Power BI Pro License: To publish to the Power BI Service and share reports with others, both you and the recipients need Power BI Pro licenses or the report needs to be placed in a Premium workspace.

**Data Refresh:** When publishing, if your report relies on data that needs to be refreshed, you can configure scheduled refresh in the Power BI Service.

**3. Exporting Data or Reports**
There are several ways to export data or visualizations from Power BI.

**Export Data (CSV/Excel):**

In Power BI Desktop, you can export data from a visualization. Right-click on a visualization (e.g., table or chart) and select Export data.
You can export it as a CSV or Excel file. This is useful if you need the underlying data for further analysis outside Power BI.

**Export to PDF:**

In Power BI Desktop, go to the File menu and select Export. Choose Export to PDF.

This option generates static snapshots of your report that can be shared with stakeholders who don’t need to interact with the report online but want to view the visualizations as-is.
