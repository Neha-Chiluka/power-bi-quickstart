### Lesson 1: Relationships

#### Demo 1: Working with Relationships in Power BI

1. Ensure the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20778C-MIA-DC** and **20778C-MIA-SQL** virtual machines are running, log on to **20778C-MIA-SQL** as **ADVENTUREWORKS\\Student** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. In the **D:\\Demofiles\\Mod05** folder, run **Setup.cmd** as Administrator.

3. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**.

4. If prompted to continue this operation, type **Y**, and then press Enter.

5. When the script completes, press any key to close the window.

6. On the Taskbar, click **Power BI Desktop**.

7. In the **Welcome to** **Power BI Desktop** window, click **Already have a Power BI account? Sign in**.

8. In the **Sign in** dialog box, enter your account credentials, and then click **Sign in**.

9. In the **Power BI Desktop** window, click **Get data**.

10. In the **Get Data** dialog box, click **Excel**, and then click **Connect**.

11. In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to **D:\\Demofiles\\Mod05\\Demo**, click **Adventure Works Sales Data.xlsx**, and then click **Open**.

12. In the **Navigator** dialog box, select the **DimCurrency**, **DimCustomer**, **DimDate**, **DimProduct**, **DimPromotion**, **DimSalesTerritory**, and **FactInternetSales** check boxes, and then click **Load**.

13. In the views pane on the left-hand side, click **Model**.

14. Point out that Power BI has created the relationships automatically. The layout represents a star schema.

15. Maximize the tables in the relationship diagram to display all columns.

16. Point out that Power BI has not created a relationship to **DimDate** from **FactInternetSales**.

17. On the **Home** tab, click **Manage Relationships**.

18. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, click **New**.

19. In the **Create relationship** dialog box, in the top table list, click **FactInternetSales**. When the table preview appears below, click the **OrderDateKey** column.

20. In the bottom table list, click **DimDate**. When the table preview appears below, click the **DateKey** column.

21. Check that the **Cardinality** is set to **Many to one (*:1)**, the **Cross filter direction** is **Single**, and **Make this relationship active** is selected, and then click **OK**.

22. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, click **Close**.

23. In the diagram, in the **FactInternetSales** table, click the **DueDateKey** column. Drag the **DueDateKey** column to the **DateKey** column in the **DimDate** table. Point out the dotted line to show that the relationship is inactive. This is because there is more than one related column in the two tables.

24. In the diagram, in the **FactInternetSales** table, click the **ShipDateKey** column. Drag the **ShipDateKey** column to the **DateKey** column of the **DimDate** table. Point out the dotted line to show that the relationship is inactive.

25. Point out that the relationships from **FactInternetSales** to **DimCurrency**, **DimProduct**, **DimPromotion**, and **DimSalesTerritory**, have a cross filter direction of **Single**, indicated by the single arrow icon. These are lookup tables, so should be Single.

26. On the **Home** tab, click **Manage Relationships**.

27. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, double-click the **FactInternetSales (CurrencyKey)** relationship.

28. In the **Edit relationship** dialog box, in the **Cross filter direction** list, ensure **Single** is selected, and then click **OK**.

29. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, double-click the **FactInternetSales (ProductKey)** relationship.

30. In the **Edit relationships** dialog box, in the **Cross filter direction** list, ensure **Single** is selected, and then click **OK**.

31. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, double-click the **FactInternetSales (PromotionKey)** relationship.

32. In the **Edit relationships** dialog box, in the **Cross filter direction** list, ensure **Single** is selected, and then click **OK**.

33. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, double-click the **FactInternetSales (SalesTerritoryKey)** relationship.

34. In the **Edit relationships** dialog box, in the **Cross filter direction** list, ensure **Single** is selected, and then click **OK**.

35. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, click **Close**.

36. Click the relationship line between **FactInternetSales** and **DimCustomer**. Point out that this is a one to one relationship because the FactInternetSales table only contains an extract. Normally this would be many to one. This must be changed so it is ready for the remainder of the data to be loaded later.

37. Right-click the relationship line between **FactInternetSales** and **DimCustomer**, and then click **Delete**.

38. In the **Delete Relationship** dialog box, click **Delete**.

39. On the **Home** tab, click **Manage Relationships**.

40. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, click **New**.

41. In the **Create relationship** dialog box, in the top table list, click **FactInternetSales** and in the data preview, click the **CustomerKey** column.
